<h1>My notes</h1>
<b>The web</b>  
<p>The web is a bunch of computers talking to each other. Clicking on a link sends http request <br /> to a server and retrieves HTML  file  and sends it to your web browser to display the page </p>
<p><b>HTML</b> stands for <em>hyper text markup language</em> and is what forms the majority of content on the web </p>

<b>HTML</b> is made using elements, tags are what tell the browser which element to use. <br /> "p" tag is for paragraphs, "br" is for line breaks, "b" for bolding text "em" for emphasis <br /> "img" for embedding images "a" for putting links into pages. <br /> some tags have attributes "img" has <b>src</b> for the url of the image and <b>alt</b> for placeholder text <br />if the img link is broken or for blind people. "a" <b>href</b> for the url to another HTMl document <br />
<P><b>Make</b> sure to close tags that require closing, the computer only know what you tell it to do, a misplace tag can create alot of problems
</P>
<p><b>Inline</b> elements dont disrupt the flow of text like an <em>a</em> tag. <b>block</b> elements create and invisble box around the content inside of them   </p>
